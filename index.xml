      <description>&amp;ldquo;You’d better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace. It’s unpleasantly like being drunk.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What’s so unpleasant about being drunk?&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;You ask a glass of water.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ndash; Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy
 From my favorite TV show, Jeopardy Q: To live until you are very very old or to widen one&amp;rsquo;s pupils.  A: What is dilate? Q: The ant that bothers Siddhartha.  A: What is Budapest?</description>

      <title>A Kind of Person, or Kind-Of a Person?</title>

      <description>I close my eyes and imagine a world where I am only this: a violinist on a stage, where the music becomes my everything. I often play this way, temporarily blind to the reality that, after my final note fades, I will spend the rest of tonight staring blankly at a blinking terminal cursor.
Music has many parallels with computer science research, at least the classical chamber music that I play.</description>

      <title>The Breaking Point</title>
      <link>https://tslilyai.github.io/tidbits/break/</link>

      <description>To live is to see breaking points everywhere:
the fragility of our bodies;
the tenuous barrier between tranquility and tears
the abrupt stop when a car recklessly turns the corner;
the pause when lungs exhaust their air;
the punctuation that appears in our sentences to prevent them from running
&amp;hellip;
and running
&amp;hellip;
and running
&amp;hellip;
and running
&amp;hellip;
until the marathon in our minds says
NO
MORE
and our eyes glaze over with ennui and frustration and everything in between and we can only wish for there</description>

      <title>The Scalable Commutativity Rule</title>
      <link>https://tslilyai.github.io/papers/scr/</link>

      <description>The scalable commutativity rule states that whenever interface operations commute, they have a conflict-free implementation. The initial SOSP 2013 paper included a full formal treatment of the rule, a detailed explanation of Commuter (an automated scalability testing tool), and how we applied the rule and Commuter to build a POSIX file system and virtual memory system. We are now exploring further the relationship between commutativity and scalability driven by the insights we gained from verifying the SCR.</description>

      <title>enClosure: Group Communication via Encounter Closures</title>

      <description>enClosure is a service providing group communication based on encounter closures for mobile and IoT applications. We implemented a prototype implementation for Android and the Microsoft Embedded Social Cloud platform. Using real-world traces, we showed that enClosure provides a privacy-preserving, secure platform for a wide range of group communication applications rangingfrom connecting attendees of a large event and virtual guest books to disseminating health risk warnings, lost-and-found, and tracing missing persons.</description>

      <title>STO: Software Transactional Objects</title>

      <description>STO is a Software Transactional Memory (STM) that improves performance by tracking abstract operations instead of memory words.</description>

      <title>Dislocated</title>
      <link>https://tslilyai.github.io/tidbits/dislocated/</link>

      <description>Informal studies indicate that the pain of a dislocated elbow far exceeds that of a fractured or broken arm. After the shock wears off, every small motion sends flames through your entire body. And to make it worse, there’s the nauseating churn in your stomach when you see your arm, twisted at a gruesome angle.
My own informal study this past January1, however, would beg to differ. I can’t deny that the physical pain was bad; in fact, it remains the most physically painful experience of my life.</description>

      <title>A Key Algorithm</title>

      <description>I sit next to thousands of keys. Physical, shiny, golden keys, which unlock hundreds of rooms. My hands ache from the past hours of sorting these keys, meticulously hanging them on piercing hooks and carefully selecting a handful at a time to slip into opaque bags.
This was the most mind-numbing experience all summer, worse than staring at a blank wall; I could feel my brain cells shriveling up as they memorized 4-digit key codes and fruitlessly struggled to optimize a procedure that was inherently unscalable.</description>

      <title>Jailed by FreeCell</title>

      <description>Recently, I’ve noticed two things:
 I’ve begun playing FreeCell again, but my emotional profile while playing is unrecognizable. I always tell myself that it’s enough to “try my best”, but I can’t actually figure out what “trying my best” means.  These two observations have been on my mind lately, and I believe they’re connected on a deeper level. This is my best (slightly rambling) explanation of the connection in my mind.</description>
