      <title>The Scalable Commutativity Rule</title>

      <description>The scalable commutativity rule states that whenever interface operations commute, they have a conflict-free implementation. The initial SOSP 2013 paper included a full formal treatment of the rule, a detailed explanation of Commuter (an automated scalability testing tool), and how we applied the rule and Commuter to build a POSIX file system and virtual memory system. We are now exploring further the relationship between commutativity and scalability driven by the insights we gained from verifying the SCR.</description>

      <title>enClosure: Group Communication via Encounter Closures</title>

      <description>The enClosure project is part of a larger project addressing EbN: Encounter-based Networking. enClosure is a service providing group communication based on encounter closures for mobile and IoT applications. We implemented a prototype implementation for Android and the Microsoft Embedded Social Cloud platform. Using real-world traces, we showed that enClosure provides a privacy-preserving, secure platform for a wide range of group communication applications rangingfrom connecting attendees of a large event and virtual guest books to disseminating health risk warnings, lost-and-found, and tracing missing persons.</description>

      <description>STO is a Software Transactional Memory (STM) that improves performance by tracking abstract operations instead of memory words.
