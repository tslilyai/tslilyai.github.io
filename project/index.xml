      <title>The Scalable Commutativity Rule</title>

      <description>The scalable commutativity rule states that whenever interface operations commute, they have a conflict-free implementation. The initial SOSP 2013 paper included a full formal treatment of the rule, a detailed explanation of Commuter (an automated scalability testing tool), and how we applied the rule and Commuter to build a POSIX file system and virtual memory system. We are now exploring further the relationship between commutativity and scalability driven by the insights we gained from verifying the SCR.</description>

      <title>Encounter-Based Communication</title>

      <description>New applications enabled by personal smart devices and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) increasingly require communication in the context of an encounter, defined as an interval of physical co-location. Examples include social exchange among individuals who met or shared an experience, and interaction among personal and IoT devices that provide location-based services. This style of communication has unique requirements not met by existing systems: it should be spontaneous, privacy-preserving, secure, and possible both during and after an encounter.</description>

      <description>STO is a Software Transactional Memory (STM) that improves performance by tracking abstract operations instead of memory words.
