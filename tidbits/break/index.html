    <p>To live is to see breaking points everywhere: the abrupt stop when a car recklessly turns the corner; the pause when lungs exhaust their air; the fragility of our bodies; the punctuation that appears in our sentences to prevent them from running and running and running and running and running until the marathon in our minds says NO MORE and our eyes glaze over with a mixture of ennui and frustration and our only desire is for there to be a</p>

<p>&mdash; Break &mdash;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Although breaks are everywhere, I struggled with them first in music. Whether playing the music of Bach or Shostakovich (and don’t even get me started on John Cage<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), we were always told,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feel the rest.</p>
<p>The silence is just as important as the notes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The silence could be a hiccup, a gasp, a breath held in prolonged anticipation. Without such breaks, music may as well be white noise. Breaks transition us from one phrase to the next, through one phase to another. But I would always rush through them, eager to move on, too bored to wait.</p>
<p>There is something thrilling in continuous cyclic motion and pushing past the breaking point, whether it be physically or emotionally. But in a time when the music of my life has been left on repeat, with each rendition increasingly meaningless, it feels as if I’m playing a piece that my fingers learned too well and my mind forgot. Daily life is a song that has lost its meaning, but which I cling to because I know it: it is stable. Each repeat only makes it more difficult to move on, more challenging to start anew rather than to start another.</p>
<p>With only myself (and occasionally some research excitement or the weather) injecting randomness into these repetitive days, I’ve tried to take the advice of my music teachers and endure the transitions from one thing to the next with purpose. And just like rediscovering an overplayed song, I have grown to appreciate the life I was rushing through a bit more<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and have found new ways to listen to it<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. After all, if my life is the song I must play, I mean to play it well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added &ldquo;commutes&rdquo; between meetings because I noticed I’m much more on time when I need to travel to a meeting than when I just need to click my mouse. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Like writing this, i.e., taking a break to make some kind of point about breaks. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
