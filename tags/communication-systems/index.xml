      <description>New applications enabled by personal smart devices and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) increasingly require communication in the context of an encounter, defined as an interval of physical co-location. Examples include social exchange among individuals who met or shared an experience, and interaction among personal and IoT devices that provide location-based services. This style of communication has unique requirements not met by existing systems: it should be spontaneous, privacy-preserving, secure, and possible both during and after an encounter.</description>
