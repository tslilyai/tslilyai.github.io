      <title>The Scalable Commutativity Rule</title>

      <description>The scalable commutativity rule states that whenever interface operations commute, they have a conflict-free implementation. The initial SOSP 2013 paper included a full formal treatment of the rule, a detailed explanation of Commuter (an automated scalability testing tool), and how we applied the rule and Commuter to build a POSIX file system and virtual memory system. We are now exploring further the relationship between commutativity and scalability driven by the insights we gained from verifying the SCR.</description>
